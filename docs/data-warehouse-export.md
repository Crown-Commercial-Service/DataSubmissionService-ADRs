# Data Warehouse Export

To enable CCS to perform deeper analysis and reporting on submission data, the
RMI application generates an export of various data related to tasks and their
submissions.

There are four export files that are generated: tasks; submissions; invoices;
contracts.

See the [Data Warehouse Documentation](https://github.com/Crown-Commercial-Service/DataSubmissionServiceAPI/blob/develop/docs/data-warehouse-export.md) for a full outline of the data being exported.
